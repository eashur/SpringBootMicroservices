# SpringBootMicroservices

This is a sample project that uses Spring Boot Microservices
movie-catalog-service makes external API calls to movie-info-service and rating-data-service 
and gets needed data to show movie titles with short description and rating.

All external calls made through Discovery Server as caller side descoveryu

All the data hardcoded for now just to demonstrate microswrvices instead of spending too much time to databse connections
